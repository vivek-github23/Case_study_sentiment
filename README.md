**Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM**
*Overview*

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. 
The model is trained to classify text into Neutral, Positive, or Negative sentiments. The project also 
includes model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
